# Stone Currency
Stone Currency is a web application developed to facilitate the conversion of monetary values from US dollars to Brazilian reals. With a friendly and intuitive interface, the application allows users to quickly obtain the updated value of their foreign currency in Brazilian reals.

Upon opening the application, the user is presented with two input fields, where they can enter the value they want to convert and the exchange rate of the state. The application is updated in real time, with exchange rates updated from reliable sources, ensuring that the displayed value is accurate and updated every 30 seconds.
